# powershell-CID-Deletion-Script
Deletes CID findings via Powershell. You have to create a input.txt file on a public share and put in the paths which inlucde the files for deletion. Then you have to start the script. Script creates an output.csv file

I created this script for a Swiss Bank which had several CIDs to delete.
